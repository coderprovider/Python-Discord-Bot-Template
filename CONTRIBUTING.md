## All code changes happen through pull requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Keep consistency with the current state of the codebase, this includes but is not limited to naming convention, Discord embeds, etc.
3. Format the code of the files you've edited with the **autopep8** formatter.
4. Issue that pull request!

## Commit messages guidelines
This project uses [`Conventional Commits 1.0.0`](https://conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) hence your commit messages **must** follow the same convention or your contributions will be ignored, refused or assigned to another user or maintainer.

## Create a GitHub [Issue](https://github.com/kkrypt0nn/Python-Discord-Bot-Template/issues) and **then** a pull request
Start contributing by first [opening a new issue](https://github.com/kkrypt0nn/Python-Discord-Bot-Template/issues/new/choose). Once that is done, you can create a pull request for the issue.
